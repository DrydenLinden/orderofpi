            Cruel but fair, the Inquisitor reads the charges and hears the case for the Defendant. 
            If the Defendant has not the cash to plead innocence (whatever the Accuser has paid plus 
            an additional five dollars), the Inquisitor will have no choice but to find the defendant 
            Guilty and pass the sentence of an immediate pie in the face of
            the condemned!

            Counsellor will still stand by the Condemned for the
            execution.
